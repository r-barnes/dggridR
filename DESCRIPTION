Description: Spatial analyses involving binning require that every bin have the same area, but this is impossible using a rectangular grid laid over the Earth or over any projection of the Earth. Discrete global grids use hexagons, triangles, and diamonds to overcome this issue, overlaying the Earth with equally-sized bins. This package provides utilities for working with discrete global grids, along with utilities to aid in plotting such data.
